# fractol

The window should be square (same HEIGHT and WIDTH) because it only uses
one variable (range) for the horizontal and vertical range of the windows.
If you want a rectangular window you need to add the other variable.

## Optimization
The program is slow making zoom. Someone told me, it could do better using threads,
but pthread's functions were not authorized. Maybe in the bonus part...
